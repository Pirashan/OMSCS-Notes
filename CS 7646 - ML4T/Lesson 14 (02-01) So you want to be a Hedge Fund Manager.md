# Lesson 14

In this lesson we will learn about computational investing, portfolio management, and what portfolio managers do. Typically, portfolio managers will be responsible for some type of fund and how well the fund performs.

## Types Of Funds

There are various types of funds a portfolio manager might handle:

- **ETF (exchange traded fund)** are funds which:
  - Have ability to buy and sell just like stocks
  - May consist of a basket of stocks
  - Are very transparent and liquid
- **Mutual Fund** are funds which:
  - Have ability to buy and sell at the end of day
  - Only disclose holdings quarterly
  - Are less transparent and liquid
- **Hedge Fund** are funds which:
  - Only have the ability to buy and sell by agreement
  - Are not required to disclose holdings
  - Are not transparent and may be difficult to liquidate

## Liquidity And Capitalization

**Liquidity** refers to the ease at which one could buy or sell shares or holdings. **Capitalization** refers to how much the company is worth according to the number of shares and the price of each share.

Note that the price of a stock does not necessarily reflect the value of a company but the price at which the stock is trading at.

## Incentives For Fund Managers

How are portfolio managers compensated? One way to calculate compensation is by examining **AUM (assets under management)** which refers to the amount of money managed by the fund. The compensation also varies for fund type:

- ETFs: compensation is through expense ratios which are some percentage of AUM (typically very low for ETFs)
- Mutual funds: compensation is also through expense ratios which are some percentage of AUM (however, higher than ETFs)
- Hedge funds: compensation is typically based on around 2% of the AUM and 20% of profits made (_two and twenty_ rule)

However, recently the compensation for majority of hedge funds are lower than _two and twenty_.

## How Funds Attract Investors

What type of investor does a hedge fund attract?

- Wealthy individuals
- Institutions
- Funds of funds

Why would these types of investors invest in a hedge fund?

- Proven track record
- Simulation and a good story
- Good portfolio fit

## Hedge Fund Goals And Metrics

There are a several goals that a hedge fund might have:

- Beat a benchmark (e.g., outperform the S&P 500)
- Obtain absolute return (through _long_ or _short_)

_Long_ is when a hedge fund makes positive bets on stocks they think are going to go up. _Short_ is when a hedge fund makes negative bets on stocks they think are going to go down.

How would an investor measure how well a hedge fund is doing? They may do so through examining:

- Cumulative returns (gains/losses over some period of time)
- Volatility (standard deviation)
- Risk/reward ratio (Sharpe ratio)
