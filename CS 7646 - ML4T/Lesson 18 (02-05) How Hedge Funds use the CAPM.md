# Lesson 18

Hedge funds try to find stocks which will yield a higher market relative return or lower market relative loss. In this lesson we examine how a hedge fund might leverage CAPM to determine these stocks.

## Two Stock CAPM Math

For [long-short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-shortequity.asp) strategies, it is possible to lose out on a market bet even with perfect $\alpha$ and $\beta$ if we do not have the proper _allocations_. How do we find the proper allocations for each stock such that our risk is zero (zero $\beta$)? We may leverage CAPM (shown below) to determine the set of allocations (weights) which would minimize risk

$r_p(t) = \sum_{i} w_i (\beta_i r_m(t) + \alpha_i(t))$

Once the proper weights are found which minimizes risk, we can compute the portfolio return. Note though that the beta values are not guaranteed in the future.

## CAPM For Hedge Funds Summary

Hedge funds may utilize CAPM as follows:

- Given:
  - $\alpha_i$ (forecast for a particular stock)
  - $\beta_i$ (risk for a particular stock)
- Solution: find $beta_p = 0$ such that market risk is minimized (find appropriate weights for each stock $w_i$)

Utilizing CAPM allowed for long-short strategies to emerge.
