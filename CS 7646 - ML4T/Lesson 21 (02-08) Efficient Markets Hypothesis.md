# Lesson 21

In terms of technical analysis, the assumption is that there is information in historical share price and volume data we may discover and exploit to gain a competitive edge in the market. Regarding fundamental analysis, the assumption is that there is information in fundamental data (e.g., earnings) which may be exploited to gain a competitive edge in the market.

However, the **EMH (Efficient Markets Hypothesis)** does not agree with the views of technical or fundamental analysis. In this lesson, we examine [EMH](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp) in more detail.

## EMH Assumptions

Scientifically reviewed by Eugene Fama in 1970, the EMH is a hypothesis that asserts that asset prices reflect all available information. Key assumptions of the EMH are:

1. Market is largely driven by for-profit investors
2. New information arrives randomly
3. Prices adjust quickly
4. Prices reflect all available information

## Origin Of Information

Where does information come from? Below are some general places where information comes from:

- Price and volume data (as used in technical analysis)
- Fundamental data (generally data not related to share price or volume)
- Exogenous data: information about the world that affects a particular company
- Company insiders: e.g., CEO of a company who knows details about their company before most people in the market

## Three Forms Of The EMH

There are actually three versions of the EMH:

1. **Weak EMH**: future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing historical prices
2. **Semi-strong EMH**: prices adjust rapidly to new public information
3. **Strong EMH**: prices reflect all information public and private

## Is The EMH Correct

Is the EMH correct? There are versions of the EMH which appears to have been refuted:

1. **Weak EMH**: there are hedge funds which are able to generate profit year-over-year
2. **Semi-strong EMH**: similar to the previous point, there exist hedge funds which appear to refute this
3. **Strong EMH**: is least likely to be true as there is proof that insider trading occurs

Additionally, analysis of P/E ratios over the time periods: 1890-1910, 1910-1930, 1930-1950, 1950-1970, 1970-1985, suggested that low P/E ratios at the beginning of each period corresponded to higher returns which appears to refute the semi-strong verison of EMH.
